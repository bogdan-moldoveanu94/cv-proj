This project contains all three assignments and the final project from the Computer Vision class from spring, 2017
Specific details about the requirements can be found at:
http://www.dsi.unive.it/~bergamasco/computer_vision.html


This project uses C++11 features(I have updated the cmake file in order to tell g++ this).
I have also added a resource folder with the image provided in the assignment so the make run command would work.
The project should build using the below steps, as in the original template provided here:
