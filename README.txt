This project contains all three assignments and the final project from the Computer Vision class from spring, 2017 at Ca'Foscari University.
Specific details about each of the requirements can be found at:
http://www.dsi.unive.it/~bergamasco/computer_vision.html

The final project consisted of developing a simple augmented reality system, by replacing some pre-defined markers with their corresponding pictures. 

This project uses C++11 features(I have updated the cmake file in order to tell g++ this). There is no dependency on OpenCV contrib since no advanced feature detectors like SIFT or SURF were used.

The project should build using the below steps, as in the original template provided here:
